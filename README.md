# Simplify-Video
The video version of my Simplify program.

I had the idea of making this for a long time since it's only the natural progression of the original program but what really made me finally do it was that i needed a way to turn frames of videos into simplified versions for easier AI training, and then i realised "oh wait i literally already have a program that does this"

Currently debugging and bugfixing, will release here once it's done
